    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The recipe itself is really quite simple, but it does take a few hours to marinate the steak. </p>
    <p>So plan ahead, maybe go the extra mile and make some homemade corn tortillas while you wait on the steak (highly recommend), serve them up with some ice-cold margaritas, and enjoy enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Carne asada</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Your choice of toppings</li>
        

    </ul></p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Make the carne asada. Marinate and cook the steak</li>
        <li>Prepare the toppings. While the steak cooks, go ahead and prepare whatever toppings you would like (plus the tortillas, if you feel like making a batch homemade).</li>
        <li>Assemble the tacos. Once the carne asada is cooked and has rested for at least 10 minutes, slice or dice the steak into bite-sized pieces. Load each corn tortilla with your desired amount of steak and toppings.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy</li>

    </ol></p>
