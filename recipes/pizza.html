    <h3>Steps </h3>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.</li>

            <li>To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with 1/3 cup BBQ sauce. Toss the cooked chicken with the remaining BBQ sauce, then scatter all around the pizza. Add the cheeses and red onion.</li>

            <li>Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh cilantro, if desired. Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.</li>

            <li>Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months</li>
